## Projects

**Detection of Corona Virus in Chest X-Ray Images**  
This project involved training a CNN model to detect coronavirus in chest X-ray lung images. To achieve this, we utilized data from three separate datasets.

**Arrhythmia Detection in ECG Waveforms**  
In this project, we explored different signal processing techniques, machine learning models, and deep learning models to detect arrhythmias in ECG signals.

**Tensor Processor in Memory**  
This project involved the full custom design of a multiply and accumulate unit (MAC unit) for a digital integrated circuit (IC). We primarily employed static CMOS logic for the gate design, and the entire project was implemented within the Cadence design environment.
