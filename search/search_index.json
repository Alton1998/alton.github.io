This means that PCA finds the directions in the data that have the most variation, and projects the data points onto those directions.</li> <li>Factor analysis (FA) is another linear dimensionality reduction method that is similar to PCA. However, FA is designed to find latent factors that explain the variation in the data. These factors are not necessarily orthogonal, as they can be correlated with each other.</li> <li>Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a linear dimensionality reduction method that is specifically designed for classification tasks. LDA projects data points onto a lower-dimensional subspace in such a way that the classes are as well-separated as possible.</li> <li>Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method that is often used for text analysis. NMF decomposes a matrix into two matrices, where the rows of the first matrix represent the original data points and the columns of the second matrix represent the latent factors.</li> <li>Sparse coding is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method that is often used for image analysis. Sparse coding decomposes an image into a set of basis images, where each basis image is weighted by a coefficient. The coefficients are typically sparse, meaning that most of them are zero.</li> </ul> <p>These are just a few of the many dimensionality reduction methods that are available. The best method to use for a particular task will depend on the nature of the data and the goals of the analysis.</p> <p>Here are some of the benefits of using dimensionality reduction methods:</p> <ul> <li>Reduced computational complexity: When you reduce the dimensionality of your data, you also reduce the computational complexity of tasks such as clustering, classification, and regression. This can be a major advantage when you are working with large datasets.</li> <li>Improved visualization: When you reduce the dimensionality of your data, you can often visualize it more easily. This can be helpful for understanding the relationships between different variables and for identifying patterns in the data.</li> <li>Improved performance: In some cases, dimensionality reduction can actually improve the performance of machine learning models. This is because dimensionality reduction can help to remove noise from the data and to make the data more regular.</li> </ul> <p>However, there are also some potential drawbacks to using dimensionality reduction methods:</p> <ul> <li>Loss of information: When you reduce the dimensionality of your data, you lose some of the information in the original data. This can be a problem if the information that is lost is important for the task that you are trying to perform.</li> <li>Data distortion: In some cases, dimensionality reduction can distort the data. This can make it more difficult to interpret the results of your analysis.</li> <li>Overfitting: If you reduce the dimensionality of your data too much, you can end up overfitting your model to the training data. This can lead to poor performance on the test data.</li> </ul> <p>Overall, dimensionality reduction can be a powerful tool for data analysis.

It is the third highly pathogenic and transmissible coronavirus after severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome  coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in humans. [6] The virus, primarily affecting the respiratory  system, prompted a dire need for rapid and accurate diagnostic tools. Owing to the development of molecular biology technologies, molecular diagnostic  methods have developed rapidly. Among these, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays  are regarded as the gold standard for virus detection because of their high sensitivity and  specificity.[7] However, the test is too difficult to be widely used and it requires expensive  laboratory equipment and highly-trained laboratory staff. Additionally, it faces limitations in  sensitivity, impacting its effectiveness in certain scenarios.[8] X-ray imaging emerged as a crucial diagnostic method due to its ability to reveal distinct  lung patterns associated with COVID-19. Leveraging this characteristic, our project aims to  employ advanced deep learning and machine learning models to detect COVID-19 from X-ray  images. The researchers are trying to inculcate artificial intelligence (Machine learning or deep  2 learning models) for the efficient detection of COVID-19.[9] By amalgamating diverse datasets  encompassing COVID-19 X-ray images alongside normal and pneumonia-afflicted chest X-rays,  we seek to develop an automated classification system. This study compares the efficacy of deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural  Networks (CNNs), with machine learning methodologies in identifying COVID-19 patterns within  X-ray images. The overarching goal is to contribute to the development of an intelligent diagnostic  tool that aids healthcare professionals in swift and accurate COVID-19 diagnoses based on X-ray  imagery."},{"location":"projects/chest_x_rays/#background-information","title":"Background Information","text":""},{"location":"projects/chest_x_rays/#what-is-covid-19","title":"What is COVID-19?","text":"This is a virus which has been circulating the globe since 2019 .

At the time when COVID-10 was at its peak,  there were limited kits for diagnosis but also limited hospital beds, personal protective equipment  and ventilators. Due to the sheer volume of the patients, it becomes increasingly important to  distinguish patients with severe acute respiratory illness(SARI) and COVID-19.Soon the world  found itself using X-rays and devising tools with the help of it to classify X-rays. X-rays are not  only cheap but are commonly found in various diagnostic settings. Also, they are well integrated  into the digital infrastructure. Lastly, portable X-rays also allow for the creation of makeshift  isolation wards reducing the need of PPE kits[2]."},{"location":"projects/chest_x_rays/#related-works","title":"Related Works","text":"This idea is not a novel idea and there are many models and works surrounding X-rays.  Most of these use machine learning and deep learning techniques coupled with image processing  techniques that will help classify X-Ray images. The need for such systems was spurred on by  the lack of healthcare professionals to interpret the results. However, such systems are to be  used for triaging purposes [2].  <p>  Some works are:  </p>  Coronet[4], which is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model that automatically  detects COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The model the authors proposed is based  on Xception architectures with its weights pre trained on ImageNet. Transfer learning is then done  on the COVID-19 data set and pneumonia datasets which are publicly available. This model has  achieved an overall accuracy of 89.6%. The model was experimented with 4 class classification  scenarios(COVID,Pneumonia bacterial,Pneumonia viral,normal) and 3 class  classification(COVID,Pneumonia,normal). The model achieved an overall accuracy of 89.6% and  95% respectively.  <p> </p>  \"Automated detection of COVID-19 cases using deep neural networks with X-ray  images''[5], makes use of deep neural networks. However, the model so developed here was  experimented for 2 class classification(COVID, No Findings) and 3 class classification(COVID,  No findings, Pneumonia).

Although CNN has a higher accuracy  than KNN, there are more computations involved, so it might be better to rely on KNN for resource  constraint applications of triaging COVID-19 patients. However KNN is not scalable so it's better  to rely on Deep CNN for improvements. To improve the model, structural optimization might need  to be carried out. Also, we could try the Transfer Learning approach, by training the network on  the Image Net data then on the Covid data. To appropriately benchmark our data, we should use  the COVIDx dataset, since the latest model COVID-NET has been trained on it and this is the  model to beat.

Also, we have various machine learning models that play a vital role today in software engineering and research. Some problems that AI helps us solve today are image recognition, natural language processing and recommendation systems. In addition to this AI has a new frontier, generative AI [1]. Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) are known to have high computational and memory requirements. The operations performed by GANs are convolution and deconvolution. These operations are not as compatible with conventional accelerators that are designed for convolution operations. There is a need for for customized accelerators or Application Specific Integrated Circuits like TPUs [2]. For the sake of this project we will consider neural network equations as shown in equation (1),(2),(3) and (4) where W are the weights, X are the inputs, b is the bias and f is the activation function. At the end of the day GANs are made up of two networks i.e. the generator and discriminator.   While there are several different hardware architectures for DNN acceleration, systolic array based implementations areshown to be most promising.The advantage with using systolic array based implementations that there need for buffering the inputs and routing is less complex.

It was found that the proposed architecture is 2.46 times faster than CPU and the energy consumption is reduced by 40%. The aforementioned Edge Tensor Processing used is a trimmed down version of Google Cloud TPU i.e it has smaller data memory .   [5] Adam G. M. Lewis et al. in their paper have shown how to repurpose for large-scale scientific computation. They speed up matrix multiply calculations for QR decomposition and linear systems by distributing these in the matrix multiplication units in Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Units.   [6] Pramesh Pandey et al. proposes a low power near threshold TPU design without affecting the inference accuracies. The way they achieve this is by identifying error-causing activation sequences in the systolic array and preventing timing errors from the same sequence by booting the operating voltage for specific multiply and accumulate (MAC) units. The paper improves the performance of a TPU by 2-3 times without compromising the inference accuracies.

Jouppi et al. evaluate Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), a custom ASIC accelerator for neural network inference deployed in their data centers since 2015. At the heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit multiply-accumulate (MAC) matrix unit offering 92 TeraOps/s peak throughput and a large 28MB software-managed on-chip memory. The TPU\u2019s deterministic execution model better matches the 99th percentile response time requirements compared to the varying optimizations of CPUs/GPUs aimed at boosting average throughput. The TPU\u2019s relatively small size and low power are attributed to the lack of such complex features. Benchmarking using production neural nets representing 95% of datacenter inference demand, the TPU demonstrated 15X-30X higher performance and 30X-80X better TOPS/Watt compared to contemporary Haswell CPUs and K80 GPUs. Using the GPU\u2019s GDDR5 memory could potentially triple the TPU\u2019s TOPS and boost TOPS/Watt to 70X the GPU and 200X the CPU.   [9] Yang Ni et al. perform comprehensive characterization of the performance and power consumption of Google\u2019s Edge TPU accelerator for deep learning inference. They generate over 10,000 neural network models and measure their execution time and power on the Edge TPU. Key findings reveal non-linear relationships between metrics like the number of MACs and performance/power. Critical factors like onchip/off-chip memory usage are identified as having significant impact. Based on this characterization, the authors propose PETET, a machine learning-based modeling framework that can accurately predict Edge TPU performance and power consumption online with less than 10% error for new models.
